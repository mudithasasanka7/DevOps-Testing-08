# React + TypeScript + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

🚀 I Just Completed My First Full CI/CD Pipeline Project! 💻✨
Hey LinkedIn family! 👋

I'm beyond excited to share a big milestone in my developer journey – I’ve successfully completed my first full CI/CD pipeline project using modern tools and technologies! 🛠️😄

🧠 Project Stack:
Frontend: Vite ⚡ + React ⚛️ + TypeScript 🧑‍💻

Version Control: GitHub 🐙

CI/CD Tool: Jenkins 🧱

Containerization: Docker 🐳

Image Hosting: Docker Hub 🗂️

Deployment Server: AWS EC2 (Linux) ☁️🐧

🔁 What I Achieved:
✅ Pushed my code to GitHub
✅ Jenkins pipeline automatically pulled the code
✅ Built a Docker image
✅ Logged in and pushed it to Docker Hub
✅ Deployed the Docker image to my EC2 Linux server automatically
✅ My Vite + React + TypeScript app is LIVE and running in a container! 🚀

This wasn’t just about tools – it was about learning the real-world DevOps workflow step by step. From writing pipeline scripts to managing Docker images and EC2 servers, I feel more confident in my journey toward becoming a DevOps Engineer 👨‍💻💪

💡 Lessons Learned:
🔹 Automation saves time and reduces human error
🔹 Every tool has its role in a solid pipeline
🔹 Debugging deployment issues teaches you more than just reading docs
🔹 Consistency, patience, and curiosity always win 🧩

🧩 What’s Next?
This is just the beginning! I'm now working on adding testing steps, improving container security, and learning more about Kubernetes & monitoring tools like Prometheus + Grafana 📈🔐

If you’re learning DevOps or working on your first pipeline, keep going – it’s worth it! 🚀
Happy to connect with others in the field or anyone curious about CI/CD! Let’s grow together! 🌱
